                    <h3>Central Park</h3>
                    <p>On February 15th, it was a beautiful but cold day in central park. Then people noticed there was something that kept bloting out the sun again and again. It seemed to be a flying saucer but it bright and colorful. </p>

                    <p>When the Frisbee (for the lack of a better decriptor) landed, it started quite a panic. Some people were running toward it. Some running toward it. All stopped when assumingly the disc spoke into everyone's mind in the park. It said, "I am Geoffery. I mean no harm. I simply come to the park to play". Everyone got together and then threw Geoffery back an forth in the park. It was a great time.</p>
